## About Dragoon Reader
I created this reader purely for my own enjoyment.

Feature-wise, I just wanted to read text, see images, and view footnotes—that’s enough for me.
In terms of experience, I wanted auto-resume, theme and language switching, and keyboard shortcuts—nothing more.

There are many powerful EPUB readers out there. I just wanted something simple and clean, so I built one.
And then I thought—why not share it with others who also love to read?

No ads, no restrictions, no popups. Just quiet, focused reading.
And if you feel like buying me a coffee, that would make me happy ☕

I won’t make any promises like “one coffee equals the next version.”
I’m just a beginner. This project isn’t that serious, and I don’t want to make it sound like a big deal.

Still, if you encounter any issues or have suggestions, feel free to leave a message in Issues. I’ll do my best to respond—
As long as it keeps this reader simple and clean.
